title: What is the Probability that a God Exists?
---

A few years ago, I stumbled upon an argument by seventeenth-centry mathematican, philosopher, and physicist Blaise Pascal called Pascal's wager.

The argument basically goes like this. There are only four possible states of the universe:

* A god exists and you believe in this god (Case A)
* A god exists but you do not believe in this god (Case B)
* No god exists but you believe in a god (Case C)
* No god exists and you do not believe in any god (Case D)

Each case has an associated benefit (Case A and Case D) or cost (Case B and Case C). For example, in case A, you should be rewarded for you belief through some beneficial afterlife, or constructuve reincarnation, etc. But, for example in case B, you might suffer a terrible fate after death or a similarly grave outcome. We can enumerate the benefits and costs in a payoff matrix:
