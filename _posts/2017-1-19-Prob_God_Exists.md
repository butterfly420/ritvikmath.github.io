A few years ago, I stumbled upon an argument by seventeenth-centry mathematican, philosopher, and physicist Blaise Pascal called Pascal's wager.

The argument basically goes like this. There are only four possible states of the universe:

* A god exists and you believe in this god
* A god exists but you do not believe in this god
* No god exists but you believe in a god
* No god exists and you do not believe in any god
