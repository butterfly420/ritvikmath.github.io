A few years ago, I stumbled upon an argument by seventeenth-centry mathematican, philosopher, and physicist Blaise Pascal called Pascal's wager.

The argument basically goes like this. There are only four possible states of the universe:

* You believe in a god and this god exists (Case A)
* You believe in a god but no god exists (Case B)
* You do not believe in any god but a god exists (Case C)
* You do not believe in any god and no god exists (Case D)

Each case has an associated benefit (Case A and Case D) or cost (Case B and Case C). For example, in case A, you should be rewarded for you belief through some beneficial afterlife, or constructuve reincarnation, etc. But, for example in case C, you might suffer a terrible fate after death or a similarly grave outcome. We can enumerate the benefits and costs in a payoff matrix:

Here, we assume that:

$$ A > 0, B < 0, C < 0, D > 0 $$
