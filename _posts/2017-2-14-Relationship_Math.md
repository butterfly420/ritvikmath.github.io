# Motivation

Romantic relationships, including their formation, continuation, and dissolution, are often percieved as mysterious processes eluding rationalization. Indeed, so some extent they surely are, but in another light, there must be underlying statistical trends to these processes as there are for all of the world's other happenings.

By getting to the root of the trends underlying the dissolution of romantic relationships, we can understand the main factors that lead a couple to break up or not break up. Then, given these factors, we can begin to build a model designed to measure the strength of a romantic relationship. We can then use this strength measure in predicting whether or not this couple will dissolve within some specified future period.

# The Data

The data used in this analysis comes from the <a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst" target="_blank">Stanford University Social Science Data Collection</a> and is cited in the [Notes](#not) section. This is a dataset containing individual level survey answers from a sample of 4002 adults in the United States. It contains a great variety of columns which range over a multitude of personal questions about the person and their current relationship and questions about their significant other, if they have one. 

What makes this data extra valuable is that there were follow up surveys of these individuals in the subsequent years. That is, the original survey took place in 2009 and was followed by a second wave in 2010, a third in 2011, a fourth in 2013 and a final fifth between 2014 and 2015. This adds a great depth of value because we not only get a static snapshot of the survey particpants, but also a follow up history. Indeed, it is this time component that allows us to identify couples that broke up and start asking questions about what factors might have been correlated with this dissolution.

# What are Commonalities within Dating vs. Married Couples?

We start by looking at the similarities between two people who are dating and two people who are married. Dating is often percieved as a stepping stone to a long term commitment and eventually marriage. We would thus expect there to be some stronger similarities, possibly even demographically, between married couples compared to dating couples. Let's look at these similarities on four axes: race, religion, political party, and college education.
