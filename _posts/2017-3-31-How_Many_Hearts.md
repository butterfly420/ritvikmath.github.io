The idea of two hearts beating in unison has long been a powerful image in poetry, music, and romance. Let us see what the realm of mathematics has to say about this idea. The question we will answer is a natural one, but one which will require careful analysis:

***On average, how many hearts beat in sync with yours?***
{:center}

Of course, our first question should be: **What does it mean for two hearts to beat in sync?**

We will define two basic notions in answering this question.

* Heartbeat: The number of times a heart beats per minute measured in beats per minute (BPM) 
* Offset: Given that two hearts share a heartbeat, the time delay between their beats usually measured in seconds

Thus, we say that **two hearts beat in sync if they have the same heartbeat and same offset

We will be using a half-empirial, half-theoretical approach to answering our question about how many hearts beat with yours.

First the statistics!
