In 2016 there were **27,772** students who applied to Medical Schools across the United States. Of these students, **8,883** were granted admission, **an admit rate of 32%**. But of course, the overall admit rate is not very enlightening. The data we are really interested in for this post is about **how that admit rate changes based on GPA and MCAT (Medical College Admission Test) score**.

We of course know roughly that a higher GPA and/or a higher MCAT score will lead to a higher chance of admission, all else held constant, but we want to really get down into the details here. Our analysis will progress by asking a **series of questions**:

***What are the patterns in Chance of Admission vs. MCAT and Chance of Admission vs. GPA?***

***Given these patterns, can we build an all-encompassing model to predict chance of admission given MCAT and GPA?***

***Given this model, can we reccomend a path for prospective medical school students to optimize their chance of admission?***
