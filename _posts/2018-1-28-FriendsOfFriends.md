If you're like me, you know keep down that your friends definitely have more friends than you and you wanted to find out why. We'll look at three different explanations: a talk-y verbal one, a visual one, and a hardcore math one for all of you who still aren't convinced.

# Verbal Explanation

Let's say you sort all the people in the world by how many friends they have. At the top of the list you have people with *tons* of friends and then at the bottom you have people who have very few friends. Which of these people are you more likely to have as friends? Well, its not the people at the bottom of the list because if they each have one friend then its really unlikely that *you* are that friend. 

On the flip side, if you look around the top of the list, it's much more likely that you have one of these people as a friend. Why? Just because they have more friends in total and you have much better odds of being one of their friends than of someone at the bottom of the list. 

Put in fewer words:

***People with more friends are more likely to have you as a friend***

Not buying it? Let's see the visual explanation!
