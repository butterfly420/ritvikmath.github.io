When I was a little Indian-American kid, I always loved watching action-packed Bollywood movies with my family. At the time, I thought it was mostly because they starred powerful heroes and heroines doing super cool stuff. A little older now, I realize that while this was true, it was crucial that these heroes and heroines looked like me. I realize now that there was something subconscious in my head that said: "This guy looks like me and he's doing some pretty noble and heroic stuff right now, so I must be capable of that same stuff". 

And I'd argue this is true for all kids while growing up. They can watch all the shows and movies, read all the books, have all the best teachers, but the moment they see someone who looks like them doing amazing things, all of a sudden it clicks. The reality clicks that: "Hold on, maybe I can be great too."
