So, you're gonna have a **rad kickback at your place** and wanna invite your friends **Abby, Becky, Carl, Dan, Elise, and Francine**. 

***But ....*** 

If you're inviting Abby, you ***have*** to invite Becky because they're dating and it would look sooo **shady** if you just invited one of them.

Alsooo if Becky's gonna be there, then you ***absolutely cannot*** invite Francine because they used to date and it **did not end well**.

Oh yea, and Carl and Dan are both trying to get with Elise so if Elise is coming, then ***there's no way*** that Dan or Carl can be there.

Also, you sit down and **score how much *you* want each person at your party** and come up with this list:

   <a href="/images/prefs_party_small.png"><img width="50%" src="/images/prefs_party_small.png"></a>

</figure>

**Who ends up getting an invite to your party?**

Well, since this is a pretty simple case, we can just logic it out here. 

Let's say we invite **Abby**. Then we have to also invite **Becky**. Also, then we cannot invite **Francine**. So it's either **Abby + Becky or Francine**. **Abby + Becky gives us 25 points** while **Francine gives us just 10**. Too bad for Francine ... **bye Felicia**. Abby and Becky are in.

Also, let's say we invite **Carl and Dan**. Then **Elise** cannot be there. Vice versa, we can invite **Elise** but then we cannot invite **Carl or Dan**. **Carl + Dan gives us 25** and **Elise gives us 40**. So Elise gets an invite.

So, our final guest list is ***Abby, Becky, and Elise***, for a total of 65 points out of a possible 100. Not Bad!!

But what if it’s **more complicated**. Consider a bunch of amigos and the following restrictions:

Also, this is our points list for all our friends

***Now what do we do??***

We can use a powerful mathematical solving technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming" target="_blank">Linear Programming</a> to solve this problem. 

First, we set up the problem by having a **bunch of binary (0 or 1) variables**, each corresponding to one of our potential guests. For example, in Abby's case:

$$
A = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      1 & \text{if Abby is coming to the party} \\
      0 & \text{if not} \\
\end{array} 
\right
.$$

and all other variables are defined similarly. 

So **how do we say mathematically that Becky and Francine can't both be at the party?**

Well, it's fine if **Becky is there without Francine $$(B=1, F=0)$$** or if **Francine is there without Becky $$(B=0, F=1)$$**. It's also fine if **neither is there $$(B=0, F=0)$$**. So basically, we need that **$$B+F \leq 1$$** since the only unacceptable case is if both of them are there $$(B=1,F=1 \to B+F=2)$$.

How about if some people have to be at the party together. If **Abby and Becky have to be at the party together**, then **either $$A=0,B=0 \to A+B=0$$** or **$$A=1,B=1 \to A+B=2$$**. (See the notes for discussion on how to encode this as a set of constraints compatible with Linear Programming).

We can also get a bit fancier. For example if **we can either invite one couple (Louise and John) or another couple (Kal and Heidi)** (because of the double date gone wrong), then we can encode that as: **$$\frac{1}{2}(L+J) + \frac{1}{2}(K+H) \leq 1$$** (this works because $$L+J$$ is either $$0$$ or $$2$$ and same with $$K+H$$, so this constraint ensures that $$L+J$$ and $$K+H$$ are not both $$2$$).

Putting all our **constraints** into our Linear Programming model, along with our **preference points** for the potential guests, we quickly generate the optimal drama-free guest list: ***Abby, Becky, Dan, Garfield, Ingrid***. 

Let's do a quick check to make sure we can't do better. The **highest scoring person**, Carl with 13 points, didn't get an invite! But if he did, then we have to invite **Heidi and Louise** too because of the tennis team constraint. But then we have ***DRAMA*** because we invited Heidi and Louise, whose **husbands hate each other**. Don't wanna get caught up in that mess!

So ... yea. Let's be honest. There's just some people who can't be around other people at your **kickback, bat mitzvah, wedding, etc.** And you don’t wanna deal with all that drama so just ***let the math take care if it for you. :)***

Thanks for reading and please leave comments!

# Notes

For those familiar with the procedure of Linear Programming, you know that we are only allowed to combine our constraints using AND, i.e. we can say $$x + y \leq 4$$ AND $$x - y \geq 3$$ AND etc. 

The constraint we mentioned in this post about making sure two people either attend a party together or not at all is actually an OR constraint. i.e. something like $$x = 0$$ OR $$x = 2$$. We can use something called the Big M method to convert this or constraint into a group of OR constraints. Namely, we convert the constraint $$x = 0$$ OR $$x = 2$$ into: 

$$
x \geq 0 \\
x - M \times z_1 \leq 0 \\
x + M \times z_2 \geq 2 \\
z1 + z2 = 1
$$

where we have introduced two new variables, $$z_1$$ and $$z_2$$, which are **both binary variables** and which **add up to 1**. We have also introduced a constant called **M** which is very large. We will set it to be **100**.

Note that the only two possible cases are $$(z_1, z_2) = (0, 1)$$ or $$(z_1, z_2) = (1, 0)$$. In the **former case**, our constraints reduce to:

$$
x \geq 0 \\
x \leq 0 \\
x \geq -98
$$

which all just reduces to $$x = 0$$.

In the **latter case**, our constraints reduce to:

$$
x \geq 0 \\
x \leq 100 \\
x \geq 2
$$

which reduces to 

$$
2 \leq x \leq 100
$$

In our case, x is actually the sum of the two **binary** variables representing the two people we need at the party together and so it all reduces to $$x = 2$$.

Thus, by introducing an extra set of variables, $$z_1$$ and $$z_2$$, **we are able to capture our OR constraint**.
